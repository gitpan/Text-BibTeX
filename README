INTRODUCTION
------------

Text::BibTeX is a Perl library for reading, parsing, and processing
BibTeX files.  It is the Perl half of btOOL, a pair of libraries for
dealing with BibTeX data; the C half, btparse, is needed to compile
Text::BibTeX (see below).

Text::BibTeX gives you access to the data at many different levels: you
may work with BibTeX entries as simple "field -> string" mappings, or
get at the original form of the data as a list of simple values
(strings, macros, or numbers) pasted together.  You can impose no
restrictions on the allowed/expected entry types or fields, or you can
use the structure defined by BibTeX 0.99's standard style files, or you
can invent your own.

The library is copiously documented.  After installing the module, see
the Text::BibTeX man page for a comprehensive introduction to the
system.  If you wish to dive straight in without regards for niceties
such as splitting and formatting names, defining or imposing database
structures, getting access to unprocessed field values, and other nifty
features, then you can probably get away with just reading the
Text::BibTeX::Entry man page.  Comments/criticism of the documentation
are welcome -- much of it is rather raw braindump, so may need a bit of
massaging.

In addition to the man pages embedded in each module (and available
after installation), I have written a technical report describing btOOL,
with the btparse and Text::BibTeX documentation included as appendices.
The whole report is just over 100 pages, around 45 of which make up the
Text::BibTeX documentation (the btparse documentation is a further 30
pages).  You can find it at the btOOL home page:

    http://starship.python.net/~gward/btOOL/

I may also make the btparse and Text::BibTeX manuals available as
separate PostScript files, but they aren't there as of this writing.


DEPENDENCIES
------------

Text::BibTeX requires Perl 5.004 or later and an ANSI-compliant C
compiler.

You must also have the btparse distribution, the C library underlying
Text::BibTeX.  If you didn't download btparse with Text::BibTeX, don't
sweat it; the Makefile.PL is smart enough to go out and find it for you
(using your preferred CPAN mirror if you have set one up,
http://www.cpan.org/ otherwise).  If you did download btparse, just put the
.tar.gz file in the parent of the Text::BibTeX, ie. make it a sibling of
Text-BibTex-0.32.  Text::BibTeX's Makefile.PL will unpack and configure it
for you.


BUILDING
--------

Start by generating the Makefile and other preparatory steps (most notably,
preparing the btparse package for building).

   perl Makefile.PL

This goes to some lengths to ensure that btparse, the companion C library,
is found and available.  It will configure btparse for you, so you
shouldn't have to do anything in the 'btparse' directory unless things go
wrong there.

Note that if Perl was built with a non-ANSI C compiler, you will need to
specify an ANSI compiler when running Makefile.PL.  For instance, if you're
running SunOS and Perl was built with 'cc' (non-ANSI), you will need to
build Text::BibTeX (and btparse as well, for that matter) with an ANSI
compiler such as 'gcc' or Sun's 'acc'.  This can be done for Text::BibTeX
as follows:

   perl Makefile.PL CC=gcc      # or acc, or whatever works on your system

However, this is fraught with danger and not recommended.  The only safe
thing to do is to build Perl with an ANSI-compliant compiler.  This will
probably save you trouble with other extensions that require an ANSI C
compiler.

Now, build everything:

   make

This takes care of building btparse as well as the Text::BibTeX modules, so
again you don't have to go grubbing around in the btparse directory unless
things go wrong.

Optionally, you can test and install btparse:

   cd btparse
   make test
   make install
   cd ..

(You do not have to install btparse to use Text::BibTeX; that's only needed
if you plan to do C programming using btparse.  See btparse/README for
details.)

Finally, test and install the Text::BibTeX Perl modules:

   make test
   make install

Please let me know if anything goes wrong with building either btparse
or Text::BibTeX.


BUGS AND LIMITIATIONS
---------------------

See the btparse(3) and Text::BibTeX(3) man pages for details.  Executive
summary:

  * Text::BibTeX is not thread-safe, due to a heavy dependence on
    global variables in the parser and lexical scanner components
    of btparse

  * for the same reason, you can't have multiple files open and
    being parsed at the same time; attempting to do so is an
    invalid use of btparse

  * Text::BibTeX cannot be used with an sfio-based Perl, because
    the Perl I/O API is apparently not yet up to the task of replacing
    stdio in third-party C libraries

  * there are some weird subtle bugs that I have been unable to isolate;
    if you see messages like "Subroutine format redefined at
    /usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/Text/BibTeX/Name.pm ...", please get
    in touch with me -- you're not the first to have this problem.
    However, I have been unable to reproduce the bug, much less
    isolate and fix it -- so if you can reproduce it, I need your help!


AVAILABILITY
------------

You can find the latest version of Text::BibTeX, as well as
documentation, information on known bugs, etc. at the btOOL web site:

   http://starship.python.net/~gward/btOOL/

Here you will find HTML versions of the documentation and technical
report describing the project, links to download the code, and whatever
other goodies I can come up with over time.
