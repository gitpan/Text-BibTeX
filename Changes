Revision history for Perl extension Text::BibTeX.

0.1  8 Mar 1997
	- first release

0.2  17 Sep 1997
        - fixed a bunch of little memory leaks in the btparse C library
        - rationalized the Text::BibTeX::Entry method names
        - added (incomplete) Text::BibTeX::Structure module
        - completely overhauled the parser and the interface to it;
          this necessitated many small changes to BibTeX.xs
        - greatly expanded the test suite and fixed a few little bugs
          found in the process
        - fixed the XS code to handle comment and preamble entries

0.21  6 Oct 1997
        - companion to btparse 0.21 -- mainly due to bug fixes and one
          minor interface change (bt_cite_key -> bt_entry_key) in btparse
        - documentation/portability/warning fixes
        - fixed XS code to not make an accidental second "strip quote
          characters" pass
        - fixed Entry 'print_s' method to handle all entry metatypes
        - changed Entry 'delete' method to handle a list of fields
        - started introducing changes to support the new way of 
          doing 'structure modules' -- nothing documented yet, though
        - deprecated old Structure module
